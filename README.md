# libft
My own library of C functions.

### How to use
- make --> will compile the library and generate the library named 'libft.a'
- make clean --> to clean the '*.o' files and delete the 'objs' directory
- make fclean --> cleans objects and library
- make re --> cleans objects and library and recompiles library
